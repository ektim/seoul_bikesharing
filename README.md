# Seoul bikesharing demand predictions
## Dataset
The dataset is available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/seoul-bike-sharing). It contains 
the following weather information: 
- Temperature(°C)
- Humidity(%)
- Wind speed (m/s)
- Visibility (10m)
- Dew point temperature(°C)
- Solar Radiation (MJ/m2)
- Rainfall(mm)
- Snowfall (cm)

It also contains the number of bicycles rented per hour on a given date, whether that day was a holiday or not 
and whether the service functioned at all.

## Supervised machine learning regression
In this project, I train a few regressors to predict bike sharing demand.
